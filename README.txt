App Description

It's a simple application to get Weather Info at user's locality. COntains two screens, first one checks the connectivity and denies going forward if not connected. Second screen shows the Weather Info

Design

Started developing app with MVP design techniques, but ended up in no particular design. 

Thoughts

It would have been great if it was done with MVP or MVVM design patterns. There are many dependacies inside code. Need to implement Dagger2 to get rid of.
